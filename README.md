# Student-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard-
The Student Performance Analytics Dashboard is a data analysis project built using Python to explore academic performance patterns across a large synthetic student dataset. The project analyzes how factors such as attendance, socio-economic background, parental education, school type, and demographics influence student outcomes.
🎯 Objectives

Analyze academic performance of 1200+ students

Identify trends based on gender, region, and school type

Study the impact of attendance, income, and parental education

Detect academically at-risk students

Perform subject-wise performance and correlation analysis
